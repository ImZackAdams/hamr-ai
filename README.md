# Hierarchical Adaptive Memory Retrieval (HAMR)

> **A Conceptual Proposal for Enhanced Memory Management in Large Language Models**

## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) face inherent limitations in maintaining context and memory over extended interactions. Current approaches—such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), summarization techniques, or extended context windows—struggle with inefficiencies and performance bottlenecks. **HAMR (Hierarchical Adaptive Memory Retrieval)** proposes a structured, adaptive solution to efficiently manage and retrieve memory in LLMs.

> ⚠️ **Note:** HAMR is currently a conceptual framework, not a fully implemented system.

## Problem

### Current Memory Limitations

LLMs operate within a fixed context window, leading to issues:
- **Loss of continuity**: Forgetting previous exchanges.
- **Repetition**: Redundant interactions and queries.
- **Context overload**: Inefficient usage of available tokens.

Existing solutions fall short:
- **RAG**: Dependent on query accuracy.
- **Summarization**: Loses detail and nuance.
- **Expanded context**: Computationally expensive and unsustainable.

## HAMR Proposal

### Hierarchical Memory Structure

HAMR proposes three memory tiers:

- **Short-Term Memory (STM)**: Raw, detailed recent interactions.
- **Mid-Term Memory (MTM)**: Summarized versions of past interactions, optimized for space.
- **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**: Persistent structured data, selectively retrieved based on relevance.

This structured approach aims to optimize both token efficiency and context relevance.

## Conceptual Framework

### Hierarchical Organization
- **STM**: Immediate, high-fidelity recall.
- **MTM**: Periodic summaries balancing detail and brevity.
- **LTM**: Semantic, structured information storage.

### Adaptive Retrieval
- **Semantic & Temporal Ranking**: Prioritizes relevant memories by similarity and recency.
- **Compression**: Maximizes token usage efficiency.
- **Dynamic Context Injection**: Includes only critically relevant memories.

### Efficient Context Construction
- Selective retrieval reduces prompt size.
- Maintains coherence and context accuracy.
- Reduces latency and computational overhead.

## Potential Use Cases

### Conversational AI
- **Personalized Assistants**: Seamless long-term user interaction.
- **Customer Support Bots**: Efficient case tracking.
- **Adaptive Coaching Agents**: Dynamic user engagement.

### Enterprise Knowledge Management
- **Legal & Compliance Tools**: Accurate retrieval of complex documentation.
- **Internal Knowledge Bases**: Enhanced query efficiency.
- **Healthcare AI**: Robust patient history management.

### Content Generation
- **Long-Form Writing**: Narrative consistency across extended texts.
- **Academic Research Tools**: Structured reference management.
- **Gaming NPCs**: Coherent and consistent interaction.
