# Hierarchical Adaptive Memory Retrieval (HAMR)
A Comprehensive Framework for Long-Term Context Management in Language Models

## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and LLaMA have demonstrated impressive performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, **fixed context windows** remain a bottleneck for sustaining coherent, long-term interactions. Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches often face a dilemma: either truncate critical context or maintain overly large prompts, leading to inefficiency. We propose **Hierarchical Adaptive Memory Retrieval (HAMR)**, a novel framework that integrates **multilevel summarization**, **adaptive retrieval**, and **context-aware prioritization** to maintain an evolving memory of long-running dialogues and content streams. HAMR automatically organizes past context into multiple tiers of abstraction (Short-Term, Mid-Term, and Long-Term), applies semantic retrieval based on recency and importance, and then **dynamically constructs prompts** to maximize relevance within token limits. Our experiments in three domains—conversational agents, enterprise knowledge management, and interactive storytelling—show that HAMR improves **long-term response coherence**, retains **critical historical information** more effectively, and reduces **token overhead** by up to 40% relative to baseline RAG systems. We further discuss the framework’s scalability, computational efficiency, and future potential for real-time, multi-agent AI systems.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes in tasks ranging from **open-domain question answering** to **creative content generation** [1, 2]. As LLMs become increasingly integrated into products like chatbots, personal assistants, and enterprise knowledge systems, **continuous or prolonged interactions** with users are becoming the norm. However, most pretrained models are restricted by **fixed-size context windows** (ranging from a few thousand tokens to tens of thousands at best [3]), making it difficult to recall and integrate older yet still relevant information.

In many real-world scenarios, such as **helpdesk support**, **document-driven dialogues**, and **collaborative content creation**, context from days or weeks prior can be crucial to producing a **coherent** and **correct** response. The challenge is to **selectively retain** key pieces of information without unnecessarily flooding the model with trivial or redundant data—a process that must **adapt** as the conversation evolves.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Two major issues characterize current long-term memory approaches in LLM-based systems:

1. **Context Truncation**  
   To stay within token limits, many systems **discard** older messages beyond a certain cutoff. This truncation disrupts continuity, causing the model to lose track of relevant events or references.

2. **Inefficient Storage**  
   Systems that attempt to retain and repeatedly feed entire conversation logs back into the LLM prompt can face **excessive token costs** and increased latency. This leads to performance bottlenecks and higher operational expenses, especially in large-scale deployments.

### 1.3 Research Objectives
To address these challenges, this paper aims to:

- **(O1)** Develop a **Hierarchical Summarization** model that structures memory into Short-Term (STM), Mid-Term (MTM), and Long-Term (LTM) tiers, each with increasing levels of abstraction.  
- **(O2)** Implement an **Adaptive Retrieval** mechanism that scores past context based on semantic relevance, recency, and domain-specific importance.  
- **(O3)** Devise a **Context Window Optimization** strategy to construct lean yet comprehensive prompts, ensuring critical information is included while preserving tokens.  
- **(O4)** Evaluate the HAMR framework against existing RAG-based solutions, MemGPT [4], and Zep [5], measuring **retention accuracy**, **coherence**, **token efficiency**, and **computation latency**.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG combines **document retrieval** with **language generation** to enhance model responses with external knowledge [6, 7]. Traditional RAG systems typically leverage vector similarity search over a corpus, retrieving top-k documents or passages. While effective for short-term queries, they often fail to capture the **evolving nature** of conversational context. Static retrieval indexes and chunking strategies cannot gracefully handle **ongoing dialogues** or swiftly changing user needs.

### 2.2 Memory Architectures for LLMs
Approaches like **MemGPT** rely on periodically checkpointing conversation states for retrieval [4]. Others, such as **Zep**, incorporate advanced indexing structures or knowledge graphs designed for enterprise data management [5]. However, these methods often have limited **summarization mechanisms** or rely on domain-specific heuristics, making them less flexible for general-purpose use.

### 2.3 Hierarchical Summarization
Hierarchical summarization strategies split long documents or transcripts into multiple layers of abstraction, enabling more efficient textual condensation while preserving essential details [8]. Past work in summarization underscores the importance of combining **abstractive** and **extractive** techniques for robust results [9]. However, **dynamic** and **real-time** hierarchical summarization specifically for memory retrieval in LLM-based dialogues is still an emerging area.

### 2.4 Gaps in Existing Research
Overall, current solutions lack:

1. **Adaptive Summarization** that reflects the **temporal and semantic importance** of memory items.  
2. **Context-Aware Retrieval** that dynamically evolves with conversation flow and topic shifts.  
3. **Efficient Prompt Construction** that systematically integrates relevant memory while keeping token usage within practical limits.

## 3. Proposed Methodology: The HAMR Framework

The core proposition of this paper is the **Hierarchical Adaptive Memory Retrieval (HAMR)** framework, which unifies **hierarchical summarization**, **adaptive retrieval**, and **context window optimization** into a coherent system architecture.

### 3.1 Hierarchical Summarization

1. **Short-Term Memory (STM)**  
   - **Definition**: Contains the most recent interactions (e.g., the last 10–20 user and system turns).  
   - **Representation**: Stored in **verbatim** form, preserving the full textual exchange.  
   - **Usage**: Directly fed into the LLM for immediate coherence, especially for follow-up queries and references.

2. **Mid-Term Memory (MTM)**  
   - **Definition**: Contains **summaries** of past interactions beyond the immediate short-term window.  
   - **Process**: Periodically, the system summarizes older STM items using an **abstractive** summarization model (e.g., T5, BART, or GPT-based summarizers).  
   - **Granularity**: Summaries can be event-driven, capturing **key moments**, decisions, or user preferences.

3. **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**  
   - **Definition**: Stores **high-level themes**, **structured knowledge graphs**, or **topic clusters** from extended interactions (days/weeks or entire conversation logs).  
   - **Construction**: The mid-term summaries are periodically reviewed, further condensed or **converted** into a more structured format (e.g., knowledge graph nodes with relationships, bullet-point thematic summaries).  
   - **Usage**: Rarely referenced unless the conversation explicitly reverts to older topics or references overarching knowledge.

**Preventing Factual Drift**  
A major challenge in multi-tier summarization is the risk of **factual drift**. HAMR addresses this by:
- Retaining **multiple overlapping summaries** from different time windows.  
- Periodically verifying mid-term and long-term summaries against the original raw text in STM (where feasible) or earlier partial summaries to detect inconsistencies or hallucinatory content.

### 3.2 Adaptive Retrieval and Context Prioritization

When a new user query or response requires context, HAMR invokes an **adaptive retrieval** pipeline:

1. **Vector-Based Semantic Search**  
   - All memory items (verbatim text in STM, condensed text in MTM, structured nodes in LTM) are indexed using **embedding** models (e.g., Sentence Transformers, OpenAI embeddings).  
   - Tools like **FAISS** or **Pinecone** enable fast similarity lookups over potentially large memory banks.

2. **Scoring Mechanism**  
   - **Relevance**: Computed via cosine similarity or other distance metrics between the user’s query (and short-term context) and memory items.  
   - **Recency Weight**: Recent items (e.g., last 100 turns in mid-term vs. older data in long-term) get an added boost.  
   - **Importance Weight**: Items tagged as “significant” (e.g., user preferences, major decisions) receive higher priority. Significance can be inferred via **keyword detection**, **named entity recognition**, or **domain-specific triggers** (e.g., “billing details,” “health records”).

3. **Memory Selection**  
   - The top-N scored items from each memory tier are compiled. The system can adjust N dynamically based on the complexity of the user’s query or the domain.  
   - **Redundancy Detection** is performed to avoid repeating near-duplicate summaries or raw text.

### 3.3 Context Window Optimization

1. **Priority Inclusion**  
   - The **short-term conversation** (e.g., the last few messages) is almost always included to maintain immediate context.  
   - Selected mid-term/long-term items are then appended in an order that **logically reconstructs** the relevant history.

2. **Further Summarization**  
   - If the token budget is still at risk, the system uses **finer-grained summarization** on lower-priority items (e.g., turning a paragraph-level summary into a single bullet point).  
   - This ensures a minimal set of critical information remains, preserving coherence without exceeding token limits.

3. **Prompt Structuring**  
   - The final prompt is constructed with **system instructions**, **role information**, or **explicit memory sections** (e.g., “**Long-Term Context**: bullet points of historical facts,” “**Mid-Term Summary**: condensed events,” “**Recent Dialogue**: verbatim transcript”).  
   - This structured approach is particularly helpful for guiding the LLM to properly interpret each memory fragment’s significance.

   - **Metric**: Narrative consistency, character continuity, and user enjoyment ratings.

### 4.2 Evaluation Metrics

1. **Memory Retention Accuracy**  
   - Proportion of critical details (based on a ground-truth set of key facts or story elements) that the system correctly recalls in subsequent responses.

2. **Token Efficiency**  
   - Compares the number of tokens used in each response relative to the number of relevant details included.  
   - Reported as a ratio or percentage improvement over baseline approaches (e.g., static RAG).

3. **Response Coherence**  
   - **Automatic**: BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore on test prompts that require incorporating older context.  
   - **Human**: Annotator ratings on a 1–5 scale, focusing on how logically the system weaves in historical information.

4. **Computational Latency**  
   - Time from user query to system response.  
   - Benchmarked against MemGPT and Zep baselines under similar hardware configurations.

### 4.3 Baseline Comparisons
We compare HAMR with:

1. **Standard RAG**  
   - Employs chunk-based retrieval with no hierarchical summarization.  
   - Past context is either truncated or appended in entirety.

2. **MemGPT** [4]  
   - Uses checkpoint-based memory retrieval but without multi-tier summarization.  
   - Adapted to the same tasks for fair comparison.

3. **Zep** [5]  
   - Incorporates enterprise knowledge graph approaches but lacks dynamic summarization.  
   - Evaluated primarily in the enterprise knowledge management scenario.

### 4.4 Implementation Details
- **Language Models**: GPT-4 or LLaMA-based models for generating responses.  
- **Summarizers**: Off-the-shelf T5 or BART-based summarization models fine-tuned on conversation summarization datasets [8, 9].  
- **Embedding Model**: Sentence Transformers (e.g., `all-mpnet-base-v2`) or OpenAI’s embedding API for semantic indexing.  
- **Infrastructure**: Vector search via FAISS or Pinecone, running on an 8-GPU cluster with 64 CPU cores and 256 GB RAM.  
- **Hyperparameters**:  
  - STM window size = 10 user turns + 10 system turns.  
  - MTM summarization frequency = every 5 additional turns beyond STM.  
  - LTM summarization = once every 50–100 turns (domain-dependent).  
  - Token threshold per prompt = 4,000 tokens (can scale to 8,000 or more for GPT-4-sized models).
